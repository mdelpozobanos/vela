# VELA

VELA is an R package to support data wrangling in the SAIL Databank (www.saildatabank.com).

Although functional, VELA is currently in prototype phase and lacks detailled documentation. We are working hard to resolved this as soon as possible. **Watch this space!**.

*Fun fact: The name "VELA" is just the spanish translation of "SAIL".*
